### üí° Core Features

* **Dynamic Story Progression**: The narrative unfolds based on the player's choices. Each decision leads to a new chapter, allowing for multiple branching storylines and unique playthroughs.
* **Player Character Stats**: The game tracks three core stats‚ÄîTrust, Stealth, and Intel‚Äîwhich are influenced by player choices. The user interface features animated status bars to visually represent these changes in real-time.
* **Timed Decisions**: Choices are presented with a 30-second timer, creating a sense of urgency and pressure. If the timer runs out, the game automatically selects the first available choice.
* **Choice Consequences**: Each choice has specific consequences, visibly labeled in the UI, that affect the player's stats, providing clear feedback on how decisions impact the character's abilities.
* **Achievement System**: The game includes an achievement system that rewards players for reaching certain milestones, such as making their first choice or achieving high stat values. Notifications pop up to announce these achievements.
* **Navigation & State Management**: The game features a "Go Back" function to explore different narrative paths, manual "Save" and "Load" functionality, and a "Restart" option. An optional auto-save feature is also available in the settings.

### üé® Stand-Out Features (User Interface & Experience)

* **Immersive Cyberpunk Aesthetic**: The application's design uses a futuristic, neon-drenched UI with glitch effects, a dark theme, and a custom font stack to create an authentic cyberpunk atmosphere.
* **Typewriter Effect**: Story text is revealed with a typewriter animation, simulating the feel of a terminal or neural interface loading data. The speed of this effect is customizable in the settings.
* **Dynamic Background Effects**: The background of the application is a live, animated scene with several layered effects, including a "matrix rain," a pulsing neon grid, and floating particles. These effects can be toggled on or off in the settings.
* **Responsive Design**: The UI is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Sharing Results**: At the end of the story, players can share their final stats and achievements on social media.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Players can use number keys (1, 2, 3) to select choices and keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+S for Save, Ctrl+R for Restart) for streamlined navigation.
